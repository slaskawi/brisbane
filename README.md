# Brisbane

This is an unofficial fork for a proof of concept integrating Project Brisbane into Keycloak.
It is not an OpenJDK release.
JitPack is configured to build this fork with JDK 25 as `com.github.slaskawi:brisbane:<commit>`;
local Gradle publication uses `pl.slaskawi:jipher-jce:20.1`.
The JAR does not include OpenSSL. A Keycloak UBI image using it needs JDK 25,
OpenSSL 3.5.9, and the FIPS 140-3 validated OpenSSL 3.1.2 provider installed separately.
Keycloak's current UBI image installs JDK 21, so this PoC needs a JDK 25 image variant.

Project Brisbane delivers a Java [Cryptographic Service Provider](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/26/security/java-cryptography-architecture-jca-reference-guide.html#GUID-3E0744CE-6AC7-4A6D-A1F6-6C01199E6920) (CSP)
for Java's [JCA](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/26/security/java-cryptography-architecture-jca-reference-guide.html#GUID-2BCFDD85-D533-4E6C-8CE9-29990DEB0190) framework,
enabling Java applications to use FIPS-validated cryptography in regulated environments.
Internally, the CSP delegates cryptographic operations to the [OpenSSL FIPS provider](https://docs.openssl.org/master/man7/OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS/).
The OpenSSL FIPS Provider, in turn, uses a [cryptographic module](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cryptographicmodule)
that conforms to the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) requirements specified in [FIPS 140-3](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-3/final).

In short, Brisbane bridges Java's standard cryptography interfaces and FIPS-regulated deployment requirements,
making it easier to build and run Java systems that must meet government and industry security mandates
while continuing to use familiar JCA patterns.
